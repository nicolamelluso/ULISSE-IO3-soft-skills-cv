ABOUT

I consider myself motivated, whiling to learn and work and focused on perfection. With a degree in 
Marketing at ISCAP, I'm seeking for a challenge where I can apply my theoretical and practical 

knowledge and skills for a continuous learning and improvement. I had traineeships in the Hotel 
Business, Journalism, Accounting and most recently Social Marketing.
